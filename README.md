# Rupert Reaching Data

yo github is pretty cool look at my graphs

This is just a repo for data regarding reaching kinematics. Trying to get a hold of github in the process.

update 01.27.22
we need to measure the width of the reaching shelf \
this will let us calibrate the y axis for distance instead of pixels reached \
might also be worth inverting the axis as well to prevent confusion; \
as of right now, the axis is in negative defined pixels
