This is just a repo for data regarding reaching kinematics. Trying to get a hold of github in the process.

update 01.27.22 \
we need to measure the width of the reaching shelf \
this will let us calibrate the y axis for distance instead of pixels reached \
might also be worth inverting the axis as well to prevent confusion; \
as of right now, the axis is in negative defined pixels

##
update 02.17.22\
okay so we have new data that has been uploaded to the gpu2\
we need to determine how we will compare the inhib data\
to the data of the new mocap rigs (not sure how to do this)
